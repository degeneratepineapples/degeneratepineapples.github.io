As the first official blog post I'm writing for this site, I thought it to be helpful for any possible readers to cover some quick facts behind its creation. Namely, I'll be covering the questions of who, what, when, and how. Answering the question of why deserves its own dedicated post later on.

## Who
I don't know how to differentiate between this section and my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about.html">About Me</a> page. In any case, I'm Daniel. I'm a fairly *Chinese* guy, both literally and figuratively. At the same time, I'm a pretty bad Chinese, considering how much I know about the language and the culture. If I had to describe myself, I'd say I'm really boring and introverted. I don't like talking to too many people, so I spend a lot of time by myself on my computer. In fact, this blog now gives me an even greater incentive to stay on my computer and not talk to other people. Wonderful! Anyways, I honestly don't have many hobbies outside of school. I like playing ping pong and tennis, and I've dabbled in various musical instruments but I'm not proficient at any of them. I actually hope this blog becomes one of my hobbies, so we'll see how this all turns out later down the road.

I've lived in Ocean Township, New Jersey my entire life. I attended Ivy Hedge in Oakhurst for preschool, Wayside Elementary for grades K-4, and Ocean Township Intermediate School for grades 5-8. For high school, I switched to the Monmouth County Vocational School District, where I attended [High Technology High School](http://www.hths.mcvsd.org/) in Lincroft. Now, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. Technically that means I'm based in Philadelphia, but with the whole COVID-19 still running rampant, I'm back where it all began in New Jersey.

At Penn, I'm majoring in Bioengineering and minoring in Math and Chemistry. I'm obliged to mention that I’m *premed,* but I hold many grudges against premed culture so I somewhat cringe at identifying as one. Majoring in Bioengineering and following the premed track means I take classes in pretty much every subject - Math, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Engineering, you name it. I particularly identify with the term: “jack of all trades, master of none.” In some ways, this has its advantages. I'm a person who is interested in basically all types of subjects (except poetry and modern art - screw those), so I appreciate the vast breadth of knowledge which I'm able to learn. On the other hand, I unfortunately can't say that there's a subject that sticks out to me as the one I should pursue in life. I kind of enjoy chemistry the most, but I don't think I'd ever be a chemist or a pharmacist in life. For now, I'm just focused on learning as much as I can about everything, and hopefully I'll end up working at a job I love.

I should also mention that Christianity dominates a large part of my life. My mother raised me in the church from a very young age, and I attended [Monmouth Community Christian Church](https://www.mccc.org/home/) all the way until the end of high school. Quick side note - it actually used to be called Monmouth *Chinese* Christian Church, but of course that name was a bit noninclusive since not *everyone* who attends is Chinese. Still, the church is probably 90% Chinese. Anyways, throughout high school, I served on its Youth Co-Worker and Worship teams. In the summers after both my junior and senior years, I was fortunate enough to join the missions teams which traveled to Kyrgyzstan to share the gospel. At Penn, I now regard [Renewal Presbyterian Church](https://renewalchurch.org/?fbclid=IwAR3IyuyLjbrmxgTlFWF-DdOKa3EZ5x4o6ZuSOPFVKDLKdiZQesC_IIVChJo) and its College Fellowship as my home. I also partake in [Full Measure A Cappella](http://www.full-measure.org/), Penn's *premier* Christian A Cappella group, which seeks to "**to worship-fully compel others to know Jesus Christ more through music and our lives.**"

## What
What *is* this site? Frankly, I find myself asking the same question. I eventually intend to expand this site to include more than just my blog, but that is quite far into the future. For now, this site and my blog are essentially synonymous. I don't envision there being a unifying theme to my posts - I really just plan on writing whatever comes to my mind. I don’t talk a lot with other people, nor do I post much on social media. I guess you could then say that this site exists purely as a means of self-expression. I spend a great amount of time in my internal monologue, which you’ll probably notice manifest itself in my writing style. I figured I might as well maintain a record of my thoughts somewhere, and an online blog seemed much more feasible for me than a physical journal.

## When
This site was officially conceived on August 23, 2020. You may notice that there are some blogs that predate the site's creation - don't worry, I didn't time travel. I had to blog a few times throughout high school for my English classes, so I transferred over the ones from senior year that I posted on my Medium account. I actually wrote my first blogs during Ms. Gross' class in freshman year on Edublogs, but I reread those while creating this site and my eyes literally started to bleed. Thus, I'm not going to transfer them onto this site, and I sincerely hope that no one ever unearths those abominations ever again. But as the kids say these days: **if you know, you know.** As for the rest of the blogs that predate August 23, 2020, I'm currently working on populating the site with some old reflections and pieces to make it not feel as empty.

## How
I'm going to interpret this question in terms of the technical side of how this blog exists. The site is being statically generated with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. You can find out more by visiting the [source repository](https://github.com/degeneratepineapples/degeneratepineapples.github.io). If you still have no idea how it works, I have great news: neither do I! I just know I can "beep boop bop boop" and bam! Working website! I adopted this site from my good friend Eric Zheng's [repository](https://github.com/air-wreck/eng4-blog), so I'm pretty lame myself. If you *actually* want to learn a bit more about how Github Pages builds this site using Jekyll, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) a nice introduction playlist to the entire process.

A note on comments: since this is a static site, comments aren't really a thing. For now, if you have any feedback, please send me an <a href="mailto:dadu@seas.upenn.edu">email</a>.
