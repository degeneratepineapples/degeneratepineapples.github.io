      Why, hello there! If you're reading this, then presumably I've made enough progress on this project to show my friends. If you randomly stumbled upon this site and don't actually know me, greetings!
      You're welcome to stay, but please send me an <a href="mailto:dadu@seas.upenn.edu">email</a> explaining how you found this link; I'm genuinely curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, this site houses my abysmal attempts at blogging, with possibly some other random thoughts posted as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the technical side, the site is being statically generated with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. You can find out more by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/degeneratepineapples/dp_blog">source repository</a>.
    </p>

      A note on comments: since this is a static site, comments aren't really a thing. For now, if you have any feedback, please send me an <a href="mailto:dadu@seas.upenn.edu">email</a>.

    <p>
      I'm Daniel Du, and I'm currently studying Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I suppose I should also mention that I'm <em>premed</em>, but I hold many grudges against premed culture so
      I somewhat cringe at identifying as one. I'm simultaneously interested in everything and nothing, so hopefully I'll figure out what I want to do one day. I particularly identify with the term: "jack of all trades, master of none."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do I have a blog? Actually, I had to blog a few times throughout high school for my English classes, and if you scroll back far enough, you can even find posts from that era that I've transferred onto this site.
      Since then, I've always had the smallest desire to continue doing so, but it wasn't until now that I followed through with action. I'll elaborate more on this in a future post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again, can I really be said to have a blog if I only post once every few months?
