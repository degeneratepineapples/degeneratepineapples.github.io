      Why, hello there! If you're reading this, then presumably I've made enough progress on this project to show my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you randomly stumbled upon this site and I don't personally know you, greetings!
      You're welcome to stay, and I advise you to visit the <b>About Me</b> page in the footer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, this site houses my abysmal attempts at blogging, with some other random thoughts posted occasioanlly as well.
      Please explore some of my August 2020 posts to learn the quick facts behind the creation of this site.

      For those interested in the technical side, the site is being statically generated with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.
      You can find out more by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/degeneratepineapples/degeneratepineapples.github.io">source repository</a>.

      A note on comments: since this is a static site, comments aren't really a thing. For now, if you have any feedback, please send me an <a href="mailto:dadu@seas.upenn.edu">email</a>.
