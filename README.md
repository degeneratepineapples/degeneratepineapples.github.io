> an abysmal attempt at blogging.

This is the source repository for my blogs and possibly some other random thoughts posted as well. There's not much going on here beyond your run-of-the-mill Jekyll site. The page styling is all custom done, but the post body styling is handled by [Github Markdown](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css). See the site running [here](https://degeneratepineapples.github.io/).

## running locally
Github Pages automatically builds this site using Jekyll. If you want to build it locally, you'll need to install `ruby` and get the gems `bundler`, `jekyll`, and `github-pages`. Then, you can just run `jekyll build` to generate a local `_site/` directory with the statically built website or run `jekyll serve` to additionally serve it locally on your machine.

## blog scope
I wouldn't say there's a particular theme to this blog. It's called Degenerate Pineapples, so I guess one purpose is to document how my mind degenerates over time. I'll actually explain my blog title more thoroughly in one of my first posts.
