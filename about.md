<img alt="Me, Daniel Du" src="../../img/ddu_toga.jpg" width="600px">

Hello, I'm Daniel. I hail from the great state of New Jersey, but now I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Bioengineering. I'm also <em>premed</em>, but it's not like I've experienced some divine revelation that I'm absolutely going to be a doctor one day. I just like **learning.** Unfortunately, I'm interested in everything and nothing at the same time. Great for succeeding in school, big sad when deciding what I want to do in life.

If you came to this blog to learn more about me, I have to sincerely apologize. I'm an extremely boring person with quite an emotionless and barren mind. I also don't hold very strong opinions, but I'm working on that. I don't really believe in personality tests since I can always think of so many exceptions to both sides of each question, but I'll put my most recent MBTI and Enneagram results here if you're interested:

I don't expect very many people to read these words. I also have no intentions of promoting this site on social media. Actually, while I'm on this topic, you can find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/danielkdu), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/danielduuu/), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/22abbcd3veltcxm4azpwckdca). If you're not going to doing anything else, at least follow my **Red Velvet** Spotify playlist. Please. I need the clout.

I don't talk to a lot of people, nor do I post much on social media. I guess you could then say that this site exists purely as a means of self-expression. I spend a great amount of time in my internal monologue, which youâ€™ll probably notice manifest itself in my writing style. I figured I might as well maintain a record of my thoughts somewhere, and an online blog seemed much more feasible for me than a physical journal. I go into greater depth about both myself and the background behind this blog in my August 2020 posts.
