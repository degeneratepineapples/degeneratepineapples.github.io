I'm Daniel Du, and I'm currently studying Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I suppose I should also mention that I'm <em>premed</em>, but I hold many grudges against premed culture so
I somewhat cringe at identifying as one. I'm simultaneously interested in everything and nothing, so hopefully I'll figure out what I want to do one day. I particularly identify with the term: "jack of all trades, master of none."

Why do I have a blog? Actually, I had to blog a few times throughout high school for my English classes, and if you scroll back far enough, you can even find posts from that era that I've transferred onto this site.
Since then, I've always had the smallest desire to continue doing so, but it wasn't until now that I followed through with action. I'll elaborate more on this in a future post.

Then again, can I really be said to have a blog if I only post once every few months?
