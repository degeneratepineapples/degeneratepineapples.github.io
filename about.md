<img alt="Me, Daniel Du" src="../../img/ddu_toga.jpg" width="600px">

Hello, I'm Daniel Du. I originally hail from the great state of New Jersey, where I attended High Technology High School. Now, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Bioengineering. I suppose I should also mention that I'm <em>premed</em>, but I hold many grudges against premed culture so I somewhat cringe at identifying as one. I'm unfortunately interested in everything and nothing at the same time. I particularly identify with the term: "jack of all trades, master of none."

If you came to this blog to learn more about me, I have to sincerely apologize. I'm an extremely boring person with quite an emotionless and barren mind. I also don't hold very strong opinions, but I'm working on that.

I don't expect very many people to read these words. I also have no intentions of promoting this site on social media. Actually, while I'm on this topic, you can find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/danielkdu), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/danielduuu/), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/22abbcd3veltcxm4azpwckdca). If you're not going to doing anything else, at least follow my **Red Velvet** Spotify playlist. Please. I need the clout.

I don't particularly talk a lot with other people, nor do I post much on social media. I guess you could then say that this site exists purely as a means for my self-expression. I spend a great amount of time in my internal monologue, which you'll probably notice manifest itself in my writing style. I figured I might as well maintain a record of my thoughts *somewhere*, and an online blog seemed much more feasible for me than a physical journal. I go into great depth about the background behind this blog in one of my first posts.

Read at your own discretion.
